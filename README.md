Xtream
======

Xtream is an open source complex event processing library for java. If you are looking for a java based cep just to submit some queries, there are better choices (e.g. Esper) but if you need a simple and understandable CEP library to work on it, extend it, use it and especially for researching on stream processing, Xtream is the best choice. I have developed it during my MSc and PhD era (10 years) to study on many issues like DSMS scheduling, load shedding, agent based stream processing and probabilistic stream processing (PDSMS). I redeveloped it from scrach in 2013 to make it a perfect prototype for reuse. 
Nowadays i am developing a CEP server based on Microsoft StreamInsight for a project. I found StreamInsight a real shit!! and decided to complete Xtream and publish it for others.
